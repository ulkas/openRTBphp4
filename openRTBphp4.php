 can include multiple imp objects, a use case for which might be an exchange that supports
 selling all ad positions on a given page as a bundle.  Each imp object has a required ID so that
 bids can reference them individually.  An exchange can also conduct private auctions by
 restricting involvement to specific subsets of seats within bidders.
